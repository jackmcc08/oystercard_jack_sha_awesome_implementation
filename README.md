## Add the Balance

Write an RSpec test for the Oystercard class that will test that a freshly initialized card has a balance of 0 by default, see it fail, then write an implementation (Oystercard class code) that will make the test pass.

As a customer
I want money on my card

- [x]  Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [x]  Create a unit test for the Oystercard class
- [x]  Write a failing test that checks that a new card has a balance
- [x]  Write code that will make this test pass
- [x]  Now refactor by setting the balance in initialize using an instance variable
- [x]  Remove the balance method entirely and replace with an attr_reader
